CncEngine

This is a very small, lightweight enterprise integration and enterprise service bus (esb) framework based on .Net with a focus on using it on linux boxes so that Mono must be targetted.

To Do:
- Dokumentation
- Add Profile "Mono"
- Test Mono (I must admit, I have never really worked with it)
- Unit Tests
- Database Connector
- File Connector
- Polling Entry
- Directory Listener Entry
- etc
